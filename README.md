This is a basic problem of Machine Learning using the Linear Regression algorithm. 

The problem statement is that a training dataset is given which comprises of the Time devoted by a person and his/her corresponding 
performance level. Based on this training dataset, we have to predict the performance of set of persons based on their time devoted.

Linear Regression is a technique to generate the best fit line according to the dataset and predict according to that line.

This simple project may be extended to many applications in scenarios when we have to predict something based on some features provided 
that the data is nearly linear in nature for better results.
